# Queue_Management

This was our first Hackathon project.We developed a QR based based Queue management website which can be used in all major crowd places like bank,railway stations, etc. for effective execution of queue.\
This is based on FIFO which builds a virtual queue and let people know estimated waiting time and will notify on user when moving forward in the queue.
